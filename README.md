# Gomore

This library is inspired by the Less library and css extension. Less is not more in this case. I took one look at the documentation for Less and thought: Jesus Christ.

Gomore is much less than Less, it is aimed to be a fast and simple css parser that adds a few useful functions like variables, and mixins, but doesn't try to add everything *and* the kitchen sink.

It is also written in go-lang, not JS (node.js), which makes it much more friendly and fast to use, as it's possible to crosscompile executables.

Gomore is intended to be a library that I will use with my other project, Hyde: https://github.com/jasonknight/hyde
